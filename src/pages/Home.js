          Hi, I'm Glen, an Auckland-based event and portrait photographer with a
          passion for capturing the beauty of authenticity. My photography style
          is all about making moments look natural and embracing candid shots. I
          believe that genuine emotions and spontaneous interactions are what
          truly make a photograph come alive. Let's work together to create
          stunning visuals that tell your story in the most real and unscripted
          way possible.
